Project Name:
Rhino Tracker

Summary: 
Rhino Tracker is a system designed to help locate the critically endangered One-horned Rhinoceros within Chitwan National Park, Nepal. By utilizing various data sources and employing effective tracking methods, Rhino Tracker provides real-time information on the whereabouts of these rhinos, aiding in conservation efforts.

Background:
The One-horned Rhinoceros is a highly endangered species in Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Monitoring their movements and understanding their habitat preferences is crucial for their conservation. However, manually locating and tracking these rhinos can be time-consuming and challenging. Rhino Tracker aims to simplify this process by utilizing technology to make it more efficient and accurate.

How it is used:
Users can access the Rhino Tracker system through a mobile app or website. The system integrates data from various sources, including satellite imagery, camera traps, ranger reports, and historical rhino sighting records. By analyzing this data and employing effective tracking methods, Rhino Tracker provides real-time updates on the location of the One-horned Rhinoceros within Chitwan National Park.
Users can input their current location or select specific areas within the park to receive updates on rhino sightings. The system provides information on the number of rhinos spotted, their approximate distance from the user's location, and any notable behaviors observed. Additionally, educational content about the One-horned Rhinoceros and conservation efforts is available within the app.

Data sources and tracking methods:
Rhino Tracker utilizes data from satellite imagery, camera traps placed within the park, reports from park rangers, and historical records of rhino sightings. By analyzing this data and employing effective tracking methods such as footprints, dung analysis, and observation techniques, Rhino Tracker identifies potential locations of the One-horned Rhinoceros within the park.

Challenges:
Obtaining accurate and up-to-date data from various sources can be challenging. Ensuring the privacy and ethical use of data collected from camera traps and ranger reports is essential. Effective collaboration with local authorities, conservation organizations, and researchers is crucial for the success of Rhino Tracker.

Next steps:
Research available data sources within Chitwan National Park and establish partnerships with local authorities, conservation organizations, and researchers. Develop a user-friendly mobile app or website interface to easily access real-time rhino sightings. Implement effective tracking methods based on available data to improve the accuracy of rhino location updates.
